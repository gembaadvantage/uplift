Semantic versioning the easy way. Automatic tagging and version bumping of files in your respositories based on your commit messages. Powered by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Easy to include in your CI.

## Install

Binary downloads of Uplft can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/gembaadvantage/uplift/releases) page. Unpack the `uplift` binary and add it to your PATH.

### Homebrew

To use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew tap gembaadvantage/tap
brew install uplift
```

## Quick Start

Based on the latest commit, the repository will be tagged with the next calculated version.

```sh
$ uplift bump
0.2.0
```

Uplift supports the use of a `v` prefix and includes it with subsequent bumps.

```sh
$ uplift bump
v0.2.0
```

A `dry run` can be carried out with optional `verbose` output, to show what uplift is up to.

```sh
$ uplift bump --dry-run --verbose

✅ git repo found
✅ retrieved latest commit:
'feat: a new snazzy feature'
✅ commit contains a bump prefix, increment identified as 'Minor'
ℹ️ existing version found: 0.1.0
✅ bumped version to: 0.2.0
ℹ️  Any commits will use:
joe.bloggs <joe.bloggs@gmail.com>
chore(release): a custom message
ℹ️ no files to bump, skipping!
0.2.0
```

## Configuration

Uplift can be configured through the existance of an optional `.uplift.yml` configuration file in the root of your repository. Other supported variations are: `.uplift.yaml`, `uplift.yml` and `uplift.yaml`.

```yaml
# An initial version that will be used for the first tag in your repository.
# Tags with a 'v' prefix are supported. You cannot change format after the first tag
# Defaults to 0.1.0
firstVersion: v1.0.0

# Use annotated tags instead of lightweight tags when tagging a version bump. An
# annotated tag is treated like a regular commit and contains both author details
# and a commit message. Uses the same commit message and author details provided
# Defaults to false
annotatedTags: true

# Changes the commit message when bumping files
# Defaults to ci(bump): bumped version to $VERSION
commitMessage: "chore: a custom commit message"

# Changes the commit author when bumping files
commitAuthor:
  # Name of the author
  # Defaults to the author name within the last commit
  name: "joe.bloggs"

  # Email of the author
  # Defaults to the author email within the last commit
  email: "joe.bloggs@gmail.com"

# A list of files whose version numbers should be bumped and kept in sync with the
# latest calculated repository tag.
# Defaults to an empty list
bumps:
  - # The path of the file relative to where uplift is executed
    file: ./chart/my-chart/Chart.yaml

    # A regex for matching a version within the file
    regex: "version: $VERSION"

    # If the matched version in the file should be replaced with a semantic version.
    # This will strip any 'v' prefix if needed
    # Defaults to false
    semver: true

    # The number of times any matched version should be replaced
    # Defaults to 0, which replaces all matches
    count: 1
```

### $VERSION

**`$VERSION`** is a placeholder and will match any semantic version, including a version with an optional `v` prefix.

## Transient Tags

Uplift automatically ignores any transient tag when identifying the latest version. This allows multiple tagging conventions to be safely used on your repository. A transient tag, is any tag that is not in the `1.0.0` or `v1.0.0` version format.
