## Install

Binary downloads of Uplft can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/gembaadvantage/uplift/releases) page. Unpack the `uplift` binary and add it to your PATH.

### Homebrew

To use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install gembaadvantage/tap/uplift
```

## Quick Start

Based on the latest commit, the repository will be tagged with the next calculated version.

```sh
$ uplift bump
0.2.0
```

An initial version can be provided for the first tag. By default `0.1.0` is used. Uplift supports the use of a `v` prefix and includes it with subsequent bumps.

```sh
$ uplift bump --first v0.1.0
v0.1.0
```

A `dry run` can be carried out with optional `verbose` output, to show what uplift is up to.

```sh
$ uplift bump --dry-run --verbose
