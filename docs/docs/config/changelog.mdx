# Changelog

TODO: description on changelog creation
TODO: by default ci(uplift) are excluded from the changelog, preventing uplift from adding noise

## sort

```yaml
# .uplift.yml

changelog:
  # Change the sort order of the commits within each changelog entry. Supported
  # values are asc or desc (case is ignored)
  #
  # Defaults to desc to mirror the default behaviour of "git log"
  sort: asc
```

## exclude

```yaml
# .uplift.yml

changelog:
  # A list of commits to exclude during the creation of a changelog. Provide a list
  # of conventional commit prefixes to filter on. Auto-generated commits from uplift
  # will always be excluded
  #
  # Defaults to including all commits within the generated changelog
  exclude:
    - chore(deps)
    - docs
    - ci
```
