# File Bumping

TODO: describe how it can be mixed and matched

## regex

```yaml
# .uplift.yml

bumps:
  - # The path of the file relative to where uplift is executed
    file: ./chart/my-chart/Chart.yaml

    # A regex matcher should be used when bumping the file. Multiple regex
    # matches are supported. Each will be carried out in the order they are
    # defined here. All matches must succeed for the file to be bumped
    #
    # Defaults to no matchers
    regex:
      - # The regex that should be used for matching the version that
        # will be replaced within the file
        pattern: "version: $VERSION"

        # If the matched version in the file should be replaced with a semantic version.
        # This will strip any 'v' prefix if needed
        #
        # Defaults to false
        semver: true

        # The number of times any matched version should be replaced
        #
        # Defaults to 0, which replaces all matches
        count: 1
```

## json

```yaml
# .uplift.yml

bumps:
  - # The path of the file relative to where uplift is executed
    file: ./package.json

    # A JSON path matcher should be used when bumping the file. Multiple path
    # matches are supported. Each will be carried out in the order they are
    # defined here. All matches must succeed for the file to be bumped.
    # JSON path syntax is based on https://github.com/tidwall/sjson
    #
    # Defaults to no matchers
    json:
      - # A JSON path that will be used for matching the version that
        # will be replaced within the file
        path: "version"

        # If the matched version in the file should be replaced with a semantic version.
        # This will strip any 'v' prefix if needed
        #
        # Defaults to false
        semver: true
```
