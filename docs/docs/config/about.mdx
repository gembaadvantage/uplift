# About

Uplift can be customised through a configuration file. In fact, uplift supports multiple default naming conventions. So take your pick!

- `.uplift.yml`
- `.uplift.yaml`
- `uplift.yml`
- `uplift.yaml`

:::tip Try it without a config file

Uplift is continuously being developed to work without a configuration file by using sensible defaults. We want uplift to be incredibly easy to use! 🏆
