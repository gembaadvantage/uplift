# Semantic Versioning the Easy Way

By harnessing the power of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), Uplift simplifies the release management of your project through your use of commit messages.

Built for Continuous Integration (CI), Uplift is incredibly simple to use, and its modular design allows you to choose which release cycle features you want to incorporate into your workflow. It adheres to the Semantic Versioning specification and plays nicely with other tools.

And it's built using Go so that you can install it anywhere!

## Features

- `File Bumping:` Update the semantic version within any configured file
- `Changelog Generation:` Creates and updates a changelog for each semantic release
- `Repository Tagging:` Tags your repository with the next semantic version

Uplift ❤️ Conventional Commits
