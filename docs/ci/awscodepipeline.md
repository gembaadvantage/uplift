# AWS CodePipeline

AWS provides two developer services for building code, `AWS CodePipeline` and `AWS CodeBuild`. The former being an orchestration tool, while the later executes each stage using a [buildspec](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html) file. This guide assumes both were configured manually through the AWS Console and only focuses on the gotchas[^1].

## CodePipeline

By default, CodePipeline clones a repository to S3 without the `.git` metadata folder. A [full clone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/tutorials-codecommit-gitclone.html)[^2] is needed for Uplift to run.

## CodeBuild

CodeBuild will always receive a git clone with a detached HEAD. By default, Uplift will [error](../faq/gitdetached.md) in this scenario. If performing a release, this will need to be resolved through a `git checkout`. However, the branch name is not exposed to CodeBuild by default. CodePipeline provides a [variable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-variables.html) `#{SourceVariables.BranchName}` that can be mapped to CodeBuild as an environment variable:

### IAM

Additional permissions are needed to pull and push code within AWS CodeBuild. These vary based on the SCM used.

!!!attention "Principle of Least Privilege"

    For illustration purposes, a resource type of `"*"` is used. This should always be narrowed to the specific resource when possible.

#### CodeCommit

Both the `codecommit:GitPull` and `codecommit:GitPush` IAM permissions are needed and should be added to the CodeBuild service role.

```{ .json .annotate linenums="1" hl_lines="8" }
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "CodeCommitUplift",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["codecommit:GitPull", "codecommit:GitPush"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### GitHub

The `codestar-connections:UseConnection` IAM permission is needed when interacting with GitHub through an AWS CodeStar [connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/connections-create-github.html).

```{ .json .annotate linenums="1" hl_lines="8" }
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "GitHubUplift",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["codestar-connections:UseConnection"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Buildspec

The buildspec will change depending on the CodeBuild project base image.

#### Default Amazon Images

Tested against the Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu and Windows variants.

```{ .yaml .annotate linenums="1" hl_lines="5" }
# buildspec.yml

version: 0.2
env:
  git-credential-helper: yes # (1)
phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gembaadvantage/uplift/main/scripts/install | bash
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - git checkout $BRANCH_NAME # (2)
  build:
    commands:
      - uplift release
```

1. Without this Uplift will lack any [credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.git-credential-helper) when attempting to push code back to the source SCM.
2. The `BRANCH_NAME` environment variable can be referenced directly within the buildspec, once mapped.

#### Official Uplift Image

Tested against the public `gembaadvantage/uplift` image.

!!!attention "Dealing with DockerHub Rate Limits"

    There are known issues with accessing public DockerHub repositories from AWS services, documented [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/advice-for-customers-dealing-with-docker-hub-rate-limits-and-a-coming-soon-announcement/).

```{ .yaml .annotate linenums="1" hl_lines="5" }
# buildspec.yml

version: 0.2
env:
  git-credential-helper: yes
phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - git checkout $BRANCH_NAME
  build:
    commands:
      - uplift release
```

[^1]: A preferred approach for generating an AWS CodePipeline would be to either write a CloudFormation [template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-codepipeline-pipeline.html) manually or use the [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) tooling. This is known as Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and wasn't included in the documentation to avoid unnecessary complexity.
[^2]: This strategy works for all [supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html#integrations-source) SCM providers.
