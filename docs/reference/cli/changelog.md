# Command Line

```text
Scans the git log for the latest semantic release and generates a changelog
entry. If this is a first release, all commits between the last release (or
identifiable tag) and the repository trunk will be written to the changelog.
Any subsequent entry within the changelog will only contain commits between
the latest set of tags. Basic customization is supported. Optionally commits
can be explicitly included or excluded from the entry and sorted in ascending
or descending order. Uplift automatically handles the staging and pushing of
changes to the CHANGELOG.md file to the git remote, but this behavior can be
disabled, to manage this action manually.

Uplift bases its changelog format on the Keep a Changelog specification:

https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/
```

## Usage
