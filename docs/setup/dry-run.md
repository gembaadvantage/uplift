# Run Uplift without making any Changes

New to Uplift? Want to understand how it works?

Then you have come to the right place. Use the `--dry-run` flag with any command and Uplift will run in simulation mode and output precisely what would have changed.

```sh
uplift release --dry-run
```

If you want extra information, turn on debug mode with the `--debug` flag.
